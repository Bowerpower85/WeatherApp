  # Project Title : Weather App
  ## Project Description:
  This is a simple application that allows the client to search for wether in a city of their choosing. The current weather and a 5 day forecast will be provided for a searched city. In addition searches are saved to local storage and rendered so the client can see previously searched cities for a quick reference.
